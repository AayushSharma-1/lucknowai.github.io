# Welcome To Lucknow AI

Scientia potentia est (knowledge is power)
{: .note }

Hi , Thank you all for joining the community!

I wanted to share the story behind why we started this and what drives us. I recently moved to Lucknow and wanted to connect with fellow developers, open-source enthusiasts, and hackers. However, I found that Lucknow lacks such a technology culture and community.

I remember wishing as a college student that I had a mentor to guide me and clarify my doubts. I want the next generation to have those opportunities. So I spoke with friends from Lucknow who now work at various companies and agreed to give back by mentoring youth interested in AI & ML. With that goal, We founded Lucknow AI to advance AI literacy and skills through collaborative workshops, meetups, paper discussions, and community growth. 

I am Aaditya (Ankit), a senior research engineer at [Saama AI Research Lab](https://www.saama.com/) with over 6+ years in core AI research. Some of my published papers, datasets, and benchmarks have been utilized by OpenAI in ChatGPT-4 Eval, Meta AI, and Google AI. I have contributed to open-source projects like TensorFlow, PyTorch Geometric, and HuggingFace. I love hacking things together, building open-source tools, and publishing state-of-the-art research. 

You can find more about my background & research at [aadityaura.github.io](https://aadityaura.github.io/)

Here are links to some of my key GitHub organizations and top open source projects:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/monk1337) 
* [PromptsLab](https://github.com/promptslab) - I created this organization to focus on research and experiments with generative AI and large language models. It has gained significant popularity, with one of the repositories officially recommended by OpenAI Github Team.
* [CoughResearch](https://github.com/coughresearch) - I founded this during COVID-19 with the goal of identifying the disease from cough and breathing sounds recorded on phones. We achieved good accuracy and published a paper at a top-tier conference.
* [TensorFlow-India](https://github.com/Tensorflow-India) - One of the first TensorFlow groups in India, created around 2017-18. TensorFlow later started city-wise groups, so I am not maintaining this anymore.
You can browse my top open source projects at [Codes](https://aadityaura.github.io/repositories), I love contributing to [stackoverflow (12k+)](https://stackoverflow.com/users/5904928/aaditya-ura)

You might be surprised to know that no one in the Lucknow AI community is paid or sponsored. We are just a group of coding geeks and hackers who are passionate about growing the local AI ecosystem!

We nurture Lucknow AI like our own child, volunteering time outside work or college to support the community. Seniors mentor newcomers not due to any obligation but out of a genuine desire to uplift. We contribute open-source code, curate datasets, brainstorm ideas, analyze research papers and more in the quest to push the boundaries of what AI can achieve. And we do it together as one unstoppable, collaborative force!

This is a safe space where you can learn, teach, create, and grow. Imagine the breakthrough innovations we can create when we come together as a supportive, tight-knit community! <br>
Let's put Lucknow on the map in AI and have fun along the way.

If you share this vision, then you have found your tribe. Welcome home!

Excited for the days ahead,<br>
~ Lucknow AI
